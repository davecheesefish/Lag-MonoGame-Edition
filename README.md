# Lag
A remake/update of the game that Team FAIL (David Prior and Matt Simmons) made in 48 hours at the first annual Global Game Jam in 2009.

The original constraints given were:
- The game should be related to the phrase "As long as we have each other, we shall never run out of problems".
- A game should last no longer than 5 minutes.
- The game should be related to at least one of "growth", "rushed" or "in between".

More info and downloads of the finished game can be found at [davecheesefish.com/games/lag](http://davecheesefish.com/games/lag).
